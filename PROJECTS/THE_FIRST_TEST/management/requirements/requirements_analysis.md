# Requirements Analysis for THE_FIRST_TEST Project

Date: $(date +%Y-%m-%d)
Project Manager: Gemini 2.5 Pro

## 1. Overview

The project entails the development of a simple test website. The primary goals are to demonstrate the team's capabilities, adhere to specific design guidelines, and incorporate a unique meta-documentation feature where the development process is documented directly on the live website.

## 2. Key Requirements

### 2.1. Functional Requirements

*   **FR1: Website Structure:** The website must include:
    *   A main navigation system.
    *   Multiple subpages (estimated 3-4 content pages + 1 meta-documentation page).
*   **FR2: Content Display:** Each subpage should display its respective content clearly.
*   **FR3: Meta-Documentation Display:** A dedicated section or page must display the documented thought process and development journey of the project. This content should be part of the final website product.

### 2.2. Design & UI/UX Requirements

*   **DR1: Dark Theme:** The website must feature a dark design aesthetic.
    *   **DR1.1: Color Palette:** Predominantly dark, almost black gray tones for backgrounds and main elements.
    *   **DR1.2: Accent Color:** Small, elegant, vibrant purple/magenta accents for highlights, calls-to-action, or specific UI elements.
*   **DR2: Typography:** Specific fonts must be used:
    *   **DR2.1: Body Text:** Poppins Regular.
    *   **DR2.2: Headings:** Poppins Semibold.
*   **DR3: Simplicity & Elegance:** The overall design should be cool, elegant, and not overly complex, demonstrating skill without excessive features.

### 2.3. Content Requirements

*   **CR1: Democratic Content Creation:** The thematic content for the subpages is to be decided democratically by the team. This excludes the meta-documentation content, which is predefined by its nature.

### 2.4. Non-Functional Requirements

*   **NFR1: Skill Demonstration:** The website should serve as a showcase of the team's web development skills.
*   **NFR2: Maintainability:** Given the 'simple' nature, the codebase should be clean and maintainable.

## 3. Constraints

*   **C1: Simplicity:** The project should not become overly complex or feature-rich ("nicht zu sehr ausufern").
*   **C2: Democratic Process for Content:** Content decisions (excluding meta-doc) must involve the team.

## 4. Assumptions

*   **A1:** "A few subpages" will be interpreted as 3-4 distinct content areas/pages, in addition to a home page (if applicable) and the meta-documentation page.
*   **A2:** Standard web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) will be used. A specific framework (React, Vue, etc.) decision will be made as part of the initial technical planning.
*   **A3:** The meta-documentation can be presented in a blog-like format or a dedicated section, likely using Markdown for ease of content creation by the team.

## 5. Out of Scope (To be confirmed if necessary)

*   Advanced backend functionalities (e.g., user accounts, databases) unless directly implied by the democratic content decision and agreed upon for simplicity.
*   Complex animations or interactions beyond what's needed for an elegant, simple demonstration.
*   E-commerce functionality.

## 6. Points Requiring Democratic Decision / Further Clarification

*   **DD1:** Specific topics/themes for the website subpages.
*   **DD2:** Choice of development framework/stack (if not pre-decided by architectural guidelines).
*   **DD3:** Specific number of subpages (beyond the initial estimate).
*   **DD4:** Structure and presentation style for the meta-documentation page. (e.g. blog, single page, timeline).

This analysis will serve as the foundation for the atomic task breakdown and further project planning.
