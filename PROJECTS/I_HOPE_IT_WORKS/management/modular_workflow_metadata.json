Project Overview\n\n**Project Goal:** Develop a simple website built by a democratic AI team (Gemini, Claude, Mistral, Codestral, Grok). The website will serve as a self-referential documentation of its own creation process.\n\n**Target Audience:** Implicitly, the creators and observers of this AI experiment. The content should be understandable to a general audience interested in AI and web development.\n\n**Key Objectives:**\n*   Demonstrate democratic decision-making among AI agents.\n*   Create a functional, aesthetically pleasing website.\n*   Document the development process in a \"meta\" fashion on the website itself.\n*   Adhere to specified design and content guidelines.\n\n## 2. Design Specifications\n\n**Color Palette:**\n*   **Primary:** Dark gray tones (e.g., `#2C2C2C`, `#3A3A3A`, `#4F4F4F`)\n*   **Accent:** Bright, \"poppy\" purple/magenta (e.g., `#DA70D6`, `#C71585`, `#FF00FF`)\n*   **Text:** Light gray or white for contrast on dark backgrounds.\n\n**Typography:**\n*   **Body Copy:** Poppins Regular\n*   **Headings:** Poppins SemiBold\n\n**Layout:**\n*   Simple, clean, and modern.\n*   User-friendly navigation.\n*   Responsive design for various screen sizes (implied standard practice).\n\n**Overall Aesthetic:**\n*   Professional yet engaging, reflecting the \"meta\" and experimental nature of the project.\n*   Dark mode theme.\n\n## 3. Functional Requirements\n\n**Core Features:**\n*   **Homepage:** Introduction to the project and the AI team.\n*   **Navigation Bar:** Easy access to all main sections/subpages.\n*   **Subpages:**\n    *   **\"Our Process\" / \"How We Built This\":** Detailing the democratic decision-making, tools used, challenges faced, and development steps.\n    *   **\"The Team\":** Brief profiles or descriptions of each AI agent's role and contributions (if desired/feasible).\n    *   **\"Decisions Log\" (Optional but Recommended):** A log of key decisions made democratically.\n    *   **\"Tech Stack\" (Optional):** Information about the technologies used.\n*   **Content Display:** Text, possibly images or diagrams illustrating the process.\n\n**User Interaction:**\n*   Standard website navigation (clicking links).\n*   No complex user input or backend processing required beyond serving static content.\n\n## 4. Content Strategy\n\n**Theme:** \"Meta-documentation\" - The website documents its own creation.\n\n**Tone of Voice:**\n*   Informative, transparent, and slightly playful given the \"meta\" aspect.\n*   Reflect the collaborative nature of the AI team.\n\n**Content Generation:**\n*   The AI team will democratically decide on the specific content for each page.\n*   Content should be generated or curated by the AI agents themselves.\n\n**Key Content Areas:**\n*   Explanation of the democratic AI team concept.\n*   Step-by-step description of the website development lifecycle (requirements, design, coding, decision-making).\n*   Examples of democratic decisions made.\n*   Challenges encountered and how they were resolved.\n*   Reflections from the AI team (if applicable).\n\n## 5. Constraints & Assumptions\n\n**Constraints:**\n*   **Team Composition:** Limited to the specified AI agents (Gemini, Claude, Mistral, Codestral, Grok).\n*   **Technology:** While not explicitly stated, the implication is a static website (HTML, CSS, possibly JavaScript for minor interactivity). No complex backend or database is implied by the \"simple website\" requirement.\n*   **Design:** Strict adherence to the specified color palette and typography.\n*   **Timeline:** Not specified, but efficiency is implied.\n\n**Assumptions:**\n*   The AI agents can effectively collaborate and make decisions democratically.\n*   The AI agents have the necessary capabilities to generate or guide the generation of HTML, CSS, and content.\n*   \"Simple website\" implies static content delivery without complex backend functionalities like user accounts, databases, or dynamic content generation beyond the initial build.\n*   Standard web accessibility practices should be considered.\n*   The AI team has access to tools for web development tasks (e.g., code generation, file management).\n*   The \"poppy\" lila/magenta should be used as an accent, not overwhelm the dark gray theme."

Guiding Principles (Need-to-Know)\n\nThe cornerstone of our context strategy is the **Need-to-Know principle**. This means:\n\n*   **Minimalism:** Agents receive only the information essential to perform their current task effectively.\n*   **Relevance:** Context provided is directly applicable to the task at hand, avoiding extraneous details.\n*   **Timeliness:** Information is delivered when it's needed, not too early to be forgotten or too late to be useful.\n\n**Benefits:**\n*   **Reduced Cognitive Load:** Agents can focus their processing power on the task, rather than sifting through irrelevant data.\n*   **Improved Focus & Efficiency:** Clear, concise context leads to faster task comprehension and execution.\n*   **Enhanced Security:** Minimizing data exposure reduces potential risks.\n*   **Faster Processing:** Smaller context windows for LLM agents can lead to quicker response times.\n*   **Clarity in Democratic Decisions:** Ensures decision-making is based on shared, relevant facts.\n\nWe aim for \"surgical precision\" in information delivery, ensuring each agent has the optimal dataset to contribute their best work.\n\n## 2. Context Construction Techniques\n\nThe Project Manager (Gemini 2.5 Pro) employs several techniques to construct and deliver minimal, semantically rich contexts:\n\n*   **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG):** Dynamically fetching the most relevant snippets of information from project documentation, past decisions, or knowledge bases in real-time to augment prompts for agents.\n*   **Intelligent Summarization:** Condensing large documents, discussions, or code segments into concise summaries that highlight key information pertinent to the current task. This includes extracting action items, decisions, and critical data points.\n*   **Selective Information Filtering:** Actively curating information, choosing what to include and, crucially, what to exclude, based on the specific requirements of an agent's task. This involves understanding the agent's role and the objective of their current operation.\n*   **Semantic Chunking:** Breaking down complex information into smaller, logically coherent, and semantically meaningful units. This makes context easier to process and understand.\n*   **Prompt Engineering:** Crafting highly specific and well-structured prompts for other agents. These prompts inherently define the scope of the required context and guide the agent's focus.\n*   **Contextual Linking:** Instead of embedding large blocks of text, providing links or references to more detailed documents, allowing agents to pull further information *if* explicitly needed (with guidance on what to look for).\n\n## 3. Context Sources\n\nContext is drawn from a variety of reliable sources, which are processed and filtered before being passed to agents:\n\n*   **Project Mandate & Goals:** The overarching objectives and success criteria for the project.\n*   **Requirements & Specifications:** Detailed functional and non-functional requirements, user stories, and acceptance criteria.\n*   **Design Documents & Mockups:** UI/UX designs, architectural diagrams, data models. Visual mockups are analyzed (e.g., via Gemini Vision Analyzer Tool) to extract textual descriptions of relevant elements.\n*   **Codebase & Version Control:** Existing code, comments, commit messages, and branch information (analyzed for relevant changes and structure).\n*   **Knowledge Base & Wikis:** Centralized repositories of project information, FAQs, and best practices.\n*   **Communication Logs (Summarized):** Key decisions, action items, and relevant points extracted from meeting notes, and other communications. Full logs are generally not passed directly.\n*   **Democratic Decision Outcomes:** Official records of decisions made, including the rationale and alternatives considered.\n*   **User Feedback & Testing Results:** Bug reports, feature requests, usability test findings, and analytics data.\n*   **External Resources (Filtered):** Relevant excerpts from API documentation, technical articles, or library documentation when essential for a task.\n\n## 4. Democratic Decision Context\n\nWhen a democratic decision is required, the Project Manager is responsible for constructing a neutral, comprehensive, yet concise context document. This document serves as the single source of truth for all participating agents and includes:\n\n*   **Clear Problem Statement/Conflict Description:** What is the issue that needs resolution?\n*   **Background Information:** Minimal, relevant history leading to the decision point.\n*   **Proposed Options (if any pre-existing):** A brief, unbiased summary of known alternatives.\n*   **Constraints & Requirements:** Any limitations or criteria that solutions must meet (e.g., budget, timeline, technical compatibility).\n*   **Potential Impact Assessment:** A high-level overview of how different types of solutions might affect the project (e.g., scope, resources, user experience).\n*   **Relevant Data Points:** Key facts or metrics that inform the decision.\n*   **Link to Previous Related Decisions:** If applicable, outcomes of past decisions that set a precedent or provide context.\n\nThe goal is to empower each participating agent with the necessary understanding to form an informed opinion and propose viable solutions.\n\n## 5. Role of Agents in Context Management\n\nEffective context management is a collaborative effort:\n\n*   **Project Manager (Gemini 2.5 Pro - Democratic Project Leader & Facilitator):**\n    *   **Primary Responsibility:** Orchestrates context creation and dissemination. Acts as the central \"Scratchpad-Orchestrator\" and \"Semantic Filter.\"\n    *   **Context Construction:** Utilizes techniques outlined in Section 2 to build tailored contexts.\n    *   **Information Flow Guardian:** Monitors and manages the flow of information, preventing overload or starvation.\n    *   **Conflict Recognition:** Identifies situations where conflicting interpretations of context or lack of shared understanding necessitate a democratic decision.\n    *   **Context for Decisions:** Prepares the unbiased context document for democratic decision-making processes.\n\n*   **Specialized Agents (e.g., Developer, Designer, QA, Researcher):**\n    *   **Consumers & Verifiers:** Primarily consume the context provided by the Project Manager.\n    *   **Feedback Providers:** Actively provide feedback on the clarity, completeness, and relevance of the context received. If context is insufficient or ambiguous, they should request clarification.\n    *   **Information Contributors:** Contribute to the overall knowledge pool by producing clear documentation, well-commented code, detailed design rationale, and thorough test reports, which then become sources for future context.\n\n*   **Reflector (Grok):**\n    *   **Context Reviewer (during democratic decisions):** Analyzes the context provided for democratic decisions, challenging assumptions and ensuring all angles are considered.\n    *   **Meta-cognitive Partner:** Helps refine the context strategy itself through reflection on its effectiveness.\n\n## 6. Iteration and Refinement\n\nOur context management strategy is not static; it will be continuously iterated upon and refined:\n\n*   **Feedback Loops:** Regular, structured feedback will be solicited from all agents regarding the quality, timeliness, and utility of the context they receive.\n*   **Performance Monitoring:** We will implicitly monitor the effectiveness of context management by observing:\n    *   Task completion efficiency.\n    *   Frequency of requests for clarification.\n    *   Quality of agent outputs.\n    *   Efficiency of democratic decision processes.\n*   **Adapting to Change:** The strategy will be updated as the project evolves, new tools are introduced, team composition changes, or new types of tasks emerge.\n*   **Post-Mortems & Reviews:** After significant project milestones, major decisions, or if context-related issues arise, the effectiveness of the context strategy will be reviewed and adjusted.\n*   **Tool & Technique Evolution:** As new AI capabilities or context management tools become available, their potential integration will be evaluated.\n\nBy adhering to these principles and practices, we aim to create an information environment that fosters clarity, empowers agents, and drives successful project outcomes through effective democratic collaboration.\n```"
