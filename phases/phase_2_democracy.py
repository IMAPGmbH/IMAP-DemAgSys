3. Basic content outline for each subpage
4. Navigation structure

Design constraints:
- Dark theme with purple/magenta accents
- Poppins font (Regular for body, Semibold for headings)
- Simple, elegant design
- Should demonstrate our AI collaboration skills

Consider the meta-aspect: documenting our own creation process could be a compelling theme.

Based on the democratic decision results, create a formal sitemap and navigation structure.

DEMOCRATIC DECISION RESULTS:
{decision_details}

YOUR TASK:
1. Parse the democratic decision to extract:
   - Website theme/topic
   - Number and titles of subpages  
   - Basic content outline for each page
   - Navigation structure

2. Create a formal sitemap document with:
   - Page hierarchy
   - URL structure (e.g., index.html, about.html, etc.)
   - Navigation menu structure
   - Content outlines for each page

3. Save the sitemap in: management/planning/sitemap_and_navigation.md

Format the document clearly for use by the development and content teams.
