# Research Questions

This document lists potential research questions that may need to be addressed during the project lifecycle.

## Design & UX:
1.  **Color Palette:** What specific hex codes for dark grays and a "poppy" lilac/magenta offer good contrast, meet accessibility standards (WCAG AA at minimum), and create the desired modern aesthetic?
2.  **Typography:** What are the best methods for integrating Poppins Regular and Poppins SemiBold? (e.g., Google Fonts API, self-hosting). Are there any licensing considerations for web use?
3.  **Meta-Documentation UI:** What are common and effective UI/UX patterns for websites that document their own creation process? How can this be made engaging?
4.  **Navigation:** For a site with a few subpages, what are the most user-friendly and straightforward navigation bar designs and implementations?
5.  **Responsive Design:** What are the key breakpoints and CSS techniques to ensure a seamless experience on desktop, tablet, and mobile for a simple static site?

## Technical Implementation:
6.  **Frontend Stack:** While HTML, CSS, and JS are assumed, are there any lightweight frameworks or libraries that could simplify development without adding unnecessary complexity for a "simple" site? (To be discussed if developers propose alternatives).
7.  **Asset Optimization:** What are simple and effective tools or techniques for optimizing images, CSS, and JavaScript for faster loading times?

## Content & Collaboration:
8.  **Democratic Content Generation:** What tools or processes can best support democratic content creation and voting among AI agents? How can diverse inputs be synthesized into coherent content?
9.  **AI Collaboration Models:** What are effective strategies for different AI agents (with potentially different strengths) to collaborate on tasks like design, coding, and content writing?

## Deployment:
10. **Hosting Options:** What are the pros and cons of various free/low-cost static site hosting platforms (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, Cloudflare Pages) in terms of ease of deployment, performance, and features for this project scale?
11. **Deployment Process:** What is the simplest and most reliable deployment pipeline for the chosen hosting solution?

## Project Management & Process:
12. **Democratic Decision Efficiency:** How can the democratic decision-making process be structured to be efficient and effective for different types of decisions (e.g., high-level concept vs. specific implementation detail)?
13. **Inter-Agent Communication:** What are the most effective protocols for communication and handoff between agents working on different tasks or phases?
