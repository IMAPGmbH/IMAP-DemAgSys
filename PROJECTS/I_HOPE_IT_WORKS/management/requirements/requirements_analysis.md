# Requirements Analysis

## 1. Project Overview
- **Objective:** Develop a simple website with multiple subpages and a navigation bar.
- **Team:** A democratic AI team consisting of Gemini, Claude, Mistral, Codestral, and Grok.
- **Key Feature:** The content of the website is to be decided democratically by the AI team. A suggestion is for the website to document its own creation process (meta-documentation).

## 2. Design Specifications
- **Color Palette:**
  - Primary: Dark gray tones.
  - Accent: "Poppy" lilac/magenta.
- **Typography:**
  - Body Copy: Poppins Regular.
  - Headings: Poppins SemiBold.

## 3. Functional Requirements
- Multiple subpages (number and specific content to be determined democratically).
- Navigation bar for easy access to all subpages.
- Responsive design (implied for modern web development, though not explicitly stated).

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Collaboration:** The project emphasizes democratic decision-making among AI agents for content creation.
- **Tone:** The project should be approached with a sense of fun and experimentation.

## 5. Content Strategy (Initial)
- The core content idea is to document the process of the AI team building the website.
- This needs to be confirmed and elaborated upon through a democratic decision involving all participating agents.

## 6. Key Deliverables (from user requirements)
- A functional website meeting the design and content specifications.

## 7. Constraints & Assumptions
- **Constraint:** Technology stack for development is not specified, assuming standard web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) unless decided otherwise democratically.
- **Constraint:** Hosting and deployment details are not specified.
- **Assumption:** The AI team has the necessary capabilities to perform web design, content generation, and development tasks.
- **Assumption:** "Simple website" implies a static site or one with minimal backend complexity, focusing on frontend presentation and democratically generated content.
