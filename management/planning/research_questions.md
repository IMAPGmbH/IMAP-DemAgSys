# Research Questions

This document outlines key research questions that may need to be addressed throughout the project lifecycle. Addressing these questions proactively can help mitigate risks, clarify requirements, and ensure a smoother development process.

## 1. Design & UX Questions

*   Who is the primary target audience, and what are their key needs, pain points, and technical proficiency?
*   What are the core user journeys and critical tasks users need to accomplish?
*   What are the specific accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG 2.1 AA/AAA) we must adhere to? How will compliance be tested and validated?
*   What is the desired brand identity and personality? How should the visual design and tone of voice reflect this?
*   What are the established best practices for information architecture and navigation for this type of application/website?
*   What methodologies will be used for user research and usability testing (e.g., interviews, surveys, A/B testing, prototype testing)?
*   What are the performance expectations from a UX perspective (e.g., perceived load times, interaction responsiveness)?
*   Are there existing brand guidelines, style guides, or design systems to leverage or adapt? How strictly must they be followed?
*   What are the key performance indicators (KPIs) for measuring UX success (e.g., task completion rates, error rates, user satisfaction scores, conversion rates)?
*   How will the design adapt to various devices and screen sizes (responsive vs. adaptive)? What are the priority breakpoints?
*   What are the ethical considerations related to user data, privacy, and persuasive design patterns?

## 2. Technical Implementation Questions

*   What is the preferred or mandated technology stack (frontend frameworks, backend languages/frameworks, database systems)? What are the justifications?
*   What are the scalability requirements (e.g., concurrent users, data volume growth, transaction throughput)? How will the architecture support this?
*   What are the key security threats and vulnerabilities? What security measures, protocols, and best practices will be implemented (e.g., OWASP Top 10, data encryption, authentication/authorization)?
*   Is there existing data to be migrated? What is the volume, format, and complexity? What is the migration strategy and validation process?
*   What third-party APIs or services will be integrated? What are their rate limits, reliability, security implications, and costs?
*   What are the specific performance benchmarks for critical system operations (e.g., API response times, database query efficiency, page load speed under load)?
*   What is the strategy for logging, monitoring, and alerting for application health and errors in different environments?
*   What coding standards, style guides, and version control (e.g., Git workflow) practices will the development team follow?
*   What is the comprehensive testing strategy (unit, integration, system, E2E, performance, security)? What tools and frameworks will be used?
*   Are there any licensing implications or compliance requirements (e.g., open-source licenses, data sovereignty) associated with the chosen technologies?
*   What is the strategy for managing environment-specific configurations and secrets?

## 3. Content & Collaboration Questions

*   Who are the designated content creators, reviewers, and approvers? What is the detailed content workflow from creation to publication?
*   What specific types of content are required (e.g., text, images, videos, downloadable documents)? What are their formats and specifications?
*   How will content be managed, updated, and archived post-launch? Is a Headless CMS, traditional CMS, or custom solution more appropriate? Why?
*   What is the SEO strategy? What are the keyword research, on-page optimization, and technical SEO requirements for the content?
*   How will version control and collaboration on content be handled, especially with multiple contributors?
*   What communication tools and platforms will be used for content-related discussions, feedback, and approvals?
*   What are the legal and compliance requirements for website content (e.g., copyright, privacy policies, terms of service, disclaimers)?
*   How will content accessibility (e.g., alt text for images, transcripts for videos) be ensured?
*   Is there a need for content localization or translation? If so, what is the strategy and which languages are prioritized?
*   How will content quality, accuracy, and consistency be maintained over time?

## 4. Deployment & Operations Questions

*   What is the target hosting environment (e.g., specific cloud provider (AWS, Azure, GCP), PaaS, on-premise)? What are the selection criteria?
*   What CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) pipeline will be implemented? What tools (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions) will be used?
*   What is the detailed rollback strategy in case of deployment failures or critical issues post-deployment?
*   How will application performance, uptime, and resource utilization be monitored in production? What alerting mechanisms will be in place?
*   What are the backup and disaster recovery (BDR) plans and RPO/RTO (Recovery Point Objective/Recovery Time Objective)?
*   What are the procedures for domain name registration/management and SSL/TLS certificate procurement, installation, and renewal?
*   How will environment configurations (dev, staging, UAT, production) be securely managed and synchronized?
*   Are there specific compliance requirements for the deployment environment or data handling (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS)?
*   What is the strategy for database schema migrations and updates in a live environment?
*   How will infrastructure costs be monitored and optimized?

## 5. Project Management & Process Questions

*   What is the realistic project timeline, including key phases, milestones, and deliverables?
*   What project management methodology (e.g., Scrum, Kanban, Hybrid Agile) will be adopted? Why is it suitable for this project?
*   How will project progress, risks, and issues be tracked, communicated, and reported to stakeholders? What tools will be used?
*   What are the primary communication channels, meeting cadences, and protocols for the team and stakeholders?
*   How will scope changes be formally requested, evaluated (impact, effort, cost), approved, and integrated?
*   What are the most significant project risks (technical, resource, schedule, budget, external)? What are the mitigation and contingency plans?
*   What is the defined process for democratic decision-making when conflicts or critical choices arise that require team consensus?
*   What are the explicit criteria for project phase completion, user acceptance testing (UAT) sign-off, and final project acceptance?
*   How will project knowledge, technical documentation, and lessons learned be captured, organized, and shared?
*   What are the roles, responsibilities, and availability of key stakeholders? How will their feedback be solicited and incorporated?
*   How will team capacity and velocity be estimated and managed?
