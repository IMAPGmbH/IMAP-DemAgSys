# Requirements Analysis: Democratic AI Team Website

## 1. Project Overview

**Project Goal:** Develop a simple website built by a democratic AI team (Gemini, Claude, Mistral, Codestral, Grok). The website will serve as a self-referential documentation of its own creation process.

**Target Audience:** Implicitly, the creators and observers of this AI experiment. The content should be understandable to a general audience interested in AI and web development.

**Key Objectives:**
*   Demonstrate democratic decision-making among AI agents.
*   Create a functional, aesthetically pleasing website.
*   Document the development process in a "meta" fashion on the website itself.
*   Adhere to specified design and content guidelines.

## 2. Design Specifications

**Color Palette:**
*   **Primary:** Dark gray tones (e.g., `#2C2C2C`, `#3A3A3A`, `#4F4F4F`)
*   **Accent:** Bright, "poppy" purple/magenta (e.g., `#DA70D6`, `#C71585`, `#FF00FF`)
*   **Text:** Light gray or white for contrast on dark backgrounds.

**Typography:**
*   **Body Copy:** Poppins Regular
*   **Headings:** Poppins SemiBold

**Layout:**
*   Simple, clean, and modern.
*   User-friendly navigation.
*   Responsive design for various screen sizes (implied standard practice).

**Overall Aesthetic:**
*   Professional yet engaging, reflecting the "meta" and experimental nature of the project.
*   Dark mode theme.

## 3. Functional Requirements

**Core Features:**
*   **Homepage:** Introduction to the project and the AI team.
*   **Navigation Bar:** Easy access to all main sections/subpages.
*   **Subpages:**
    *   **"Our Process" / "How We Built This":** Detailing the democratic decision-making, tools used, challenges faced, and development steps.
    *   **"The Team":** Brief profiles or descriptions of each AI agent's role and contributions (if desired/feasible).
    *   **"Decisions Log" (Optional but Recommended):** A log of key decisions made democratically.
    *   **"Tech Stack" (Optional):** Information about the technologies used.
*   **Content Display:** Text, possibly images or diagrams illustrating the process.

**User Interaction:**
*   Standard website navigation (clicking links).
*   No complex user input or backend processing required beyond serving static content.

## 4. Content Strategy

**Theme:** "Meta-documentation" - The website documents its own creation.

**Tone of Voice:**
*   Informative, transparent, and slightly playful given the "meta" aspect.
*   Reflect the collaborative nature of the AI team.

**Content Generation:**
*   The AI team will democratically decide on the specific content for each page.
*   Content should be generated or curated by the AI agents themselves.

**Key Content Areas:**
*   Explanation of the democratic AI team concept.
*   Step-by-step description of the website development lifecycle (requirements, design, coding, decision-making).
*   Examples of democratic decisions made.
*   Challenges encountered and how they were resolved.
*   Reflections from the AI team (if applicable).

## 5. Constraints & Assumptions

**Constraints:**
*   **Team Composition:** Limited to the specified AI agents (Gemini, Claude, Mistral, Codestral, Grok).
*   **Technology:** While not explicitly stated, the implication is a static website (HTML, CSS, possibly JavaScript for minor interactivity). No complex backend or database is implied by the "simple website" requirement.
*   **Design:** Strict adherence to the specified color palette and typography.
*   **Timeline:** Not specified, but efficiency is implied.

**Assumptions:**
*   The AI agents can effectively collaborate and make decisions democratically.
*   The AI agents have the necessary capabilities to generate or guide the generation of HTML, CSS, and content.
*   "Simple website" implies static content delivery without complex backend functionalities like user accounts, databases, or dynamic content generation beyond the initial build.
*   Standard web accessibility practices should be considered.
*   The AI team has access to tools for web development tasks (e.g., code generation, file management).
*   The "poppy" lila/magenta should be used as an accent, not overwhelm the dark gray theme.
