  "general_notes": [
    "Permissions are hierarchical. Deny rules override allow rules if conflicts arise (though this policy primarily uses grants).",
    "The 'ProjectManager' role has broad access for oversight and management. This should be reviewed periodically.",
    "Specific file access within a directory can be further refined by file type rules.",
    "Agents should only have write access to directories and files essential for their role to maintain the 'Need-to-Know' principle.",
    "These policies are a baseline and may be adjusted based on project phase and specific task requirements, ideally through a democratic decision process if changes are significant or contentious."
